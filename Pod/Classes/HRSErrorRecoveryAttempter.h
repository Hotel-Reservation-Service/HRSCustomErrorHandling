/**
 Add a recovery option to the attempter that is used for presentation and error
 recovery.
 
 The recovery options are stored in the order they are added to the recovery
 attempter. The first option that is added should be the default option. The
 default option shout *not* be a destructive operation.
 
 The recovery attempter can be checked for equality, however as it is not
 possible to compare two blocks for being logically equal, we are guessing that
 a recovery attempter is equal to another one, if they both have the same
 localized recovery options.
 
 @warning Make sure to add at least one recovery block that returns `NO`,
          such as a cancel recovery option, to make sure the user can break the
          error presentation cycle in the case your error recovery was not
          successful even though it should have been.
 
 @param title         A localized title to be shown on a button to represent
                      the functionality of the recovery block.
 @param recoveryBlock The block that will be executed if the user selects
                      this recovery option.
